# Week 1 - ML Basics & Linear Regression With One Variable
- This week, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data—without being explicitly programmed.
- We are going to start by covering linear regression with one variable. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an       input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and     introduce the gradient descent method for learning.
- We’ll also have optional lessons that provide a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is           necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables.
