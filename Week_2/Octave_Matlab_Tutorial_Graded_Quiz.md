## Octave / Matlab Tutorial:
### Question:1

    Suppose I first execute the following Octave/Matlab commands:
    A = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6];
    B = [1 2 3; 4 5 6];
    Which of the following are then valid commands? Check all that apply. (Hint: A' denotes the transpose of A.)


    C = A * B;
    C = B' + A;
    C = A' * B;
    C = B + A;
    
    Answer is 'C = A * B' and 'C = B' + A'. to test it create the A and B matrices in Octave and test all above commands to verify the results
