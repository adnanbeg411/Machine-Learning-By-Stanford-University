# Week 4 - Neural Networks
- Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works.
- It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, 
  it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech; 
  when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks.
