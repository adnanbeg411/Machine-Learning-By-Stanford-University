# Week 5 - Neural Networks Learning
- In Week 5, we will be learning how to train Neural Networks.
- The Neural Network is one of the most powerful learning algorithms (when a linear classifier doesn't work, this is what I usually turn to), and this week's videos explain the 'backpropagation' algorithm for training these models. 
- In this week's programming assignment, you'll also get to implement this algorithm and see it work for yourself.
