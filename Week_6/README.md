# Week 6 - Advice for Applying Machine Learning
- In Week 6, you will be learning about systematically improving your learning algorithm.
- The videos for this week will teach you how to tell when a learning algorithm is doing poorly, and describe the 'best practices' for how to 'debug' your learning algorithm and go about improving its performance.
- We will also be covering machine learning system design. 
- To optimize a machine learning algorithm, youâ€™ll need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made. 
- In these lessons, we discuss how to understand the performance of a machine learning system with multiple parts, and also how to deal with skewed data.
 -When you're applying machine learning to real problems, a solid grasp of this week's content will easily save you a large amount of work.
