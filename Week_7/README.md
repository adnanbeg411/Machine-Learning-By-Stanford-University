# Week 7 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- This week, you will be learning about the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. 
- SVMs are considered by many to be the most powerful 'black box' learning algorithm, and by posing a cleverly-chosen optimization objective, one of the most widely used learning algorithms today.
