# Week 7 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- This week, you will be learning about the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. 
- SVMs are considered by many to be the most powerful 'black box' learning algorithm, and by posing a cleverly-chosen optimization objective, one of the most widely used learning algorithms today.

## [Programming Assignment: Support Vector Machines](machine-learning-ex6)
- I have solved all the questions mentioned in 'ex6.pdf'. 
- Please follow the 'ex6.pdf' it will guide you though all the steps. 
- In all the '.m' files I have added few extra comments for better understanding.
- I have not completed the 'Optional (ungraded) exercise: Build your own dataset'
