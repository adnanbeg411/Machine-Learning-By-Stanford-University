# Week 8 - Unsupervised Learning
- This week, you will be learning about unsupervised learning. 
- While supervised learning algorithms need labeled examples (x,y), unsupervised learning algorithms need only the input (x). 
- You will learn about clusteringâ€”which is used for market segmentation, text summarization, among many other applications.
- We will also be introducing Principal Components Analysis, which is used to speed up learning algorithms, and is sometimes incredibly useful for visualizing and helping you to understand your data.
